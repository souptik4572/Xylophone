# xylophone

A simplistic xylophone application for playing tunes in the leisure time. Made exclusively for the web using simple HTML, CSS and Javascript with Howl.js for implementing the sound effects. I hope everyone will get the same enjoyment while playing with this web instrument as I had while building it.
The site is hosted [here](https://simplisticxylophone.netlify.app/).
